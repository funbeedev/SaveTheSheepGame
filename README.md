Save The Sheep is my first video game designed using [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/).
Submitted to the [itch.io Game Off 2020 jam](https://funbeedev.itch.io/save-the-sheep).

## About game

Simple 2D game in which you have to save sheep by taking them to the moon. Dodge the deadly stars and get each sheep safely on the moon! With each sheep saved the difficulty of the game increases.

### How to play
Use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate the sheep through space.
